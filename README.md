# Automated-Diabetic-Retinopathy-detection
Deep learning-based detection of Diabetic Retinopathy from retinal images. Uses CNNs and image preprocessing to classify DR severity. Includes model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Built with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenCV, and Jupyter.

👁️ Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Deep Learning
Early detection of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is crucial in preventing vision loss. This project uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify retinal fundus images into different stages of DR severity.

📂 Project Overview
Classifies fundus images into 5 DR severity levels (0–4)

Implements custom and/or pretrained CNNs (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet)

Uses image preprocessing (CLAHE, resizing, normalization)

Provides visualizations and model evaluation metrics

🧠 Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab (optional)
